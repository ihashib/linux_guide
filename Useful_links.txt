If anyone wants to get familiar with Linux and learn to use it. I use 18.04 as I need to use ROS Melodic which only supports 18.04. Also you can install Ubuntuâ€™s flavours, same thing, just the desktop environment is changed. KUbuntu, Xubuntu, Lubuntu, Ubuntu Mate etc(https://youtu.be/7BXFSraVP7k).
